- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Westernlonderin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...tellin you at first, that my english isnt very good. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning what is this  this all here about. I found out that i have in my firefox Settings, when i click on "Show certificates" there are a million or something like that on certificate management. I dont know where there aare from. Unfortunately I have to admit that i didnt pay much attention to things like that brfore.
But then I saw Cloudflare and remembered that this is something good.But the the time was up long ago.
Then I checkede uBlock, because i thought that cloudflare and uBlock had something to do with each other. 
I kjlicked on a link in uBlock "Filter lists" and I'm stranded here.
I dont know if i am at the right place here. But I thought, I start a try.
I can feel that my PC settings ana also firefox settings are getting worse the more i try to fix. uBlock the same.

So, when i am totaly wrong here, ignore me. when you have one or two tipps for a noob and they can maybe fix some problem, or if not it wont will be more bad than before, thank you.
